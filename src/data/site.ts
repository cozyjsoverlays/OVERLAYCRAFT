  },
  {
    question: "Which platforms and sizes are supported?",
    answer:
      "All four major platforms: Twitch, YouTube, Kick, and TikTok. The assets are sized and exported so they look crisp on each platform's layout.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I request changes to a pack?",
    answer:
      "Small tweaks can often be arranged — reach out and ask. For full personalization (your own character, palette, and emotes), grab a custom commission.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's your refund policy?",
    answer:
      "Because these are instant-download digital goods, all sales are final once the files have been downloaded. If you hit a technical problem, contact us and we'll fix it or make it right.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you take custom commissions?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Custom packs start at $601 and include your own character or mascot, a custom palette, every screen and alert, custom emotes, a sub badge set, and matching panels and overlays.",
  },
  {
    question: "I lost my download link — what now?",
    answer:
      "No problem. Your links are in the confirmation email we sent at purchase. If they've expired, just contact us with your order email and we'll happily re-issue them.",
