  {
    q: "What bitrate should I stream at on Twitch?",
    a: "For 1080p60 most streamers use around 6000 kbps; 1080p30 about 4500; 720p60 about 4500; 720p30 about 3000. Fast-paced games benefit from the higher end of the range, while cozy/chatting streams can go a little lower.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much upload speed do I need to stream?",
    a: "As a rule of thumb you want your upload speed (in kbps) to be at least 1.5× your video bitrate so there's headroom for audio and network overhead. This calculator checks that for you and gives a verdict.",
  },
  {
    q: "What keyframe interval should I use?",
    a: "Set the keyframe interval to 2 seconds — both Twitch and YouTube recommend it. Use a hardware encoder (NVENC, AMD, or Apple) if you have one to spare your CPU.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a max bitrate on Twitch?",
    a: "Twitch generally recommends staying around 6000 kbps for stable delivery to most viewers. YouTube allows higher bitrates, especially at 1440p and 4K.",
