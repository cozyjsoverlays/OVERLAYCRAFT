    a: "It's a clear, structured description of the overlay pack you want — your channel, vibe, aesthetic, the assets you need (Starting Soon, BRB, alerts, panels, emotes, badges) and the production specs. A good brief gets you a more accurate result whether you commission a designer or use an AI image generator.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I use the generated brief?",
    a: "Copy it and either paste it into your image generator to create the pack, or send it to a designer as your commission brief. It already includes the right sizes and OBS-ready delivery notes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this free and private?",
    a: "Yes — it's completely free, no login, and everything runs in your browser. Nothing you type is uploaded or stored on a server.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you make the pack for me?",
    a: "Yes! CozyJsStudio designs cozy custom overlay packs. Generate your brief here, then browse the shop or reach out for a custom commission and we'll bring it to life.",
