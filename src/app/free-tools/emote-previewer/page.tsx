  {
    q: "What size should a Twitch emote be?",
    a: "Twitch emotes are uploaded as a single high-resolution image and displayed at three sizes: 112×112, 56×56 and 28×28 pixels. Design at 112×112 (or larger and scale down) with a transparent background, and make sure the artwork still reads clearly at 28×28 — that's the size used in chat.",
  },
  {
    q: "What size is a Twitch sub badge?",
    a: "Twitch sub badges render at 72×72, 36×36 and 18×18 pixels. Because 18px is tiny, keep badge designs to one bold, simple shape with high contrast so they stay recognizable next to a username.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this emote previewer free, and are my files uploaded?",
    a: "It's completely free with no login. Everything runs locally in your browser using your device — your image is never uploaded to a server. You can refresh the page and it's gone.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it support animated emotes (GIF)?",
    a: "Yes. Drop in a GIF and the previews animate just like they would in chat, at each native size, so you can check that your animation still reads when it's shrunk down.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does my emote look bad at the small size?",
    a: "Fine details and thin lines disappear when an image is scaled to 28px. The fix is a bolder, simpler silhouette, fewer colors, and strong contrast. Preview at the smallest size first and design for that.",
  },
];
