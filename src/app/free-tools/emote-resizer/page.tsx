    a: "Twitch needs 112×112, 56×56 and 28×28 pixel PNGs with transparent backgrounds. This tool generates all three from a single high-resolution image so you can upload them straight to the dashboard.",
  },
  {
    q: "How big can a Discord emoji be?",
    a: "Discord emojis are 128×128 and must be under 256 KB. This resizer outputs a 128×128 PNG and flags it if the file goes over the limit so you can simplify the art.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are my images uploaded anywhere?",
    a: "No. All resizing happens locally in your browser with the Canvas API. Your image never touches a server, and everything clears when you refresh.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if my image isn't square?",
    a: "The tool centers it on a transparent square and warns you, but emotes look best when you start from a square canvas so nothing gets padded or cut.",
  },
